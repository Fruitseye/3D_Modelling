## This is my first simulation done in Blender
  - Reference: [Blender Tutorial - Quick Rigid Body Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVYYMG3QVY)
  - Took 2 days
     - Reason is while working in Blender, it became unresponsive inbetween and I forgot to SAVE
     - And REST IS HISTORY....

### Rendering
  - Video animation was done by combining 92 frames of rendered images 
  - Rendering process(Cycles) took almost 3hrs

### Improvements needed:
  - Simple work but took too much time to render 
  - Therefore **Need to optimise rendering process**
  
## Output:
